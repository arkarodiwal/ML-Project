 About the dataset Â¶
The data is basically of Red wine and consists of attributes related to the red wine variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
In this problem, the goal is to model the quality of red wine based on its physical properties i.e to determine whether the wine is "good" or "bad". We'll use the "quality" field to determine "good" or "bad".
The rest of the variables in the table will be inputs for our model.
